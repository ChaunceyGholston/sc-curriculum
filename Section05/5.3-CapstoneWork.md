# Capstone Project Work

## **Objective: -**

In this module we are going to look at more CSS, and at adding standard components to our capstone projects, that will help manage the functionality of our application.

<br>

- Additional CSS
  - Absolute and relative CSS Units
  - CSS colors and backgrounds
  - CSS custom properties and CSS Variables
  - Normalizing CSS styles across browsers
- Adding Google Fonts to a project
- Adding a collapsible Nav Bar Hamburger Icon w/ Font Awesome
- Adding a Jumbotron/Hero header as needed

<br>

<br>

## **CSS Units**

<br>

### **px**, _pixels_ (absolute):

- used for base font size and really small things like border radii

### **em** (relative):

- relative to the font size of the _parent_ element; used for font sizes

### **rem** (relative):

- relative to the font size of the _**r**oot_ element; used for margins, widths, padding

<br>

> **NOTE**: To set your "root" element font size, select the `body` element...
>
> ```css
> body {
>   font-size: 10px;
>   font-family: Georgia, serif;
> }
> ```
>
> ...and set the `font-size` value. The `font-family` will set the base font for your website.

<br>

### **vh** / **vw**, _viewport height_ and _viewport width_ (relative):

- sizing relative to viewport/window; `1vh` = 1% viewport height

### **%** (relative):

- sizing relative to parent element's property

## **Colors & CSS**

There are many different ways to specify [color in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). The three most common are _keywords_, _hexadecimal_, and _rgb_.

- We've already seen how CSS understands certain **color keywords** like `purple` or `blue`. For a list of all color keywords, visit the link above.
- You may have seen color represented with a `#` in front, like `#c55da1`. This is called a **hexadecimal** RGB value.
  - Each pair of values represents one of the color channels — _red_, _green_ and _blue_ — and allows us to specify any of the 256 available values for each.
  - These values are less easy to understand, but they are a lot more versatile than keywords — you can use hex values to represent **any** color you want to use in your color scheme.
- Similar to hexadecimal, but reformatted to be easier to read is the **rgb function**. The rgb function - `rgb()` - takes three parameters that represent the red, green, and blue channel values of the colors. Each channel is represented not by a decimal number between 0 and 255 - `rgb(197, 93, 161)`
  - There is a fourth parameter that represents the _alpha_ channel of the color, which controls **opacity** (`0` = fully transparent, `1` = solid/fully opaque). Values in between give you different levels of transparency.

## **CSS and Background Images**

To set a background image, use the `url()` function and pass in the path to the image, such as `url(path-to-img.jpg)` or `url(https://img-link.net)`

- `background-size: cover` will cover the entire HTML container, potentially distorting/zooming into/clipping the background image.
- `background-size: contain` will cover as much of the HTML container as possible _without_ clipping or distorting the background image

<br>

## **CSS Variables**

To make your site look cohesive its common practice to stick to a simple color palate of three or four colors. This often leads to multiple instances of those three/four colors in your css, potentially leading to errors from mistyping and making it difficult to switch to a different color scheme.

**CSS variables** or _custom properties_ provide a solution to this problem. To set CSS variables/custom properties, select the root element using `html` or `:root`...

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #845ec2;
  --secondary-color: #b39cd0;
  --text-primary-color: #fbeaff;
  --text-secondary-color: #00c9a7;
}
```

...and prefixing your custom property name with "`--`".

To access your custom properties, use the `var()` function and pass in the property name:

```css
.blog-post {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  color: var(--text-primary-color);
}
```

## **Stylsheet `normalize.css`**

Default styles are different across browsers, and they're usually filled to the brim with quirky (or bug-causing) behavior. We want to have control over every aspect of our style across every browser. We need to **normalize** or reset styles to make sure that _every browser_ treats our elements the _same_.

To do this, we'll add [`normalize.css` from CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/normalize) in the `head` of our HTML files, like so:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/8.0.1/normalize.min.css"
/>
```

<br>

<br>

## **Google Fonts**

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is extremely helpful to virtually assure that your selected fonts will load on any computer/device.

Select your fonts by clicking its red "+" button. Each font you select is added to a tab at the bottom right of the screen (stick to two or three fonts maximum). Clicking the tab shows your font families and how to embed them. Google Fonts constructs a custom HTML link with the font families you've selected, like this:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merriweather|Montserrat&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Google Fonts also constructs the CSS rules to specify your font families in your stylesheet:

```css
font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
font-family: "Merriweather", serif;
```

If you intend to use different font weights or italicization, make sure to click the Customize tab and select the options you want. Google Fonts will add those options to the link it constructs - notice the numbers after `Merriweather:`.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merriweather:400,900,900i|Montserrat&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## **Collapsible Nav Bar Hamburger element**

<br>

### **Font Awesome**

You will most likely want to introduce a responsive "hamburger" icon to stand in for your navigation links on smaller screens. We will use [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) for our ["hamburger"/bars icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/bars?style=solid).

The first step toward using Font Awesome icons is to link to the [Font Awesome CSS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) in our HTML. Without this, we won't have access to the necessary Font Awesome classes:

```html
<link
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/all.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

<br>

### **Adding the Nav Bar Hamburger Icon**

Next, we can add a "hamburger" icon to our HTMl by adding the following tag as a child of the `<nav>` element:

```html
<i class="fas fa-bars"></i>
```

Now we have the bars icon alongside our navigation links, but we want either one or the other to appear based on screen size. Using media queries, we can specify that when the screen gets past a certain size, the bars icon should be hidden.

```css
@media (min-width: 550px) {
  nav > .fa-bars {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

That solves our issue on bigger screens, but we still need to fix our mobile view. On our mobile view, we will want to _toggle_ the display of navigation links when the user clicks the bars icon. In the HTML, lets _add a class_ to the `<ul>` tag like `hidden--mobile`. In our CSS, _create a media query_ that targets the smaller screen size and _add a rule_ that targets that class:

```css
/* in HTML: <ul class="hidden--mobile"> */
@media (max-width: 550px) {
  .hidden--mobile {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

Finally, to add our "toggle" functionality we use JavaScript. _Add an event listener_ to our "hamburger icon" that listens for a click. Inside the event listener's callback function, _target the class list_ for the `<ul>` element inside the `<nav>` tag and _toggle_ the `hidden--mobile` class with the `toggle()` method.

```javascript
document.querySelector(".fa-bars").addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.querySelector("nav > ul").classList.toggle("hidden--mobile");
});
```

## **Jumbotron/Hero, & Border Radius**

<br>

### **Hero**

At the top of websites, it's common to see a large image with some text and possibly a button. This heading style is sometimes known as a "Jumbrotron" or "Hero" section.

To add a "Jumbotron", in your CSS, target your header and add a `background-image` with a `background-size` of `cover` and add a `height` that covers most of the screen using `vh` units (you may want to specify different heights based on screen size).

```css
header {
  background-image: url(https://source.unsplash.com/random/800x600);
  background-size: cover;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### **Border Radius**

Since `button` elements are _technically_ only supposed to be used to _submit forms_, for our "Hero" "button" we can use an `<a>` tag that we style to _look like_ a button. In our CSS, we target our `<a>` tag and add `background-color`, `padding`, and `border-radius` properties so that our `<heading>`'s `<a>` tag appears like a button.

```css
header > a {
  text-decoration: none;
  background-color: white;
  font-size: 1.5em;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

Without `border-radius`, our button would have sharp, right angle corners. Adding a few pixels of `border-radius` rounds the corners of an HTML element's border edge. A `border-radius` of `50%` creates a round button!

Once we have our `<a>` "button", all that is left is to center our text and "button" using Flexbox. Piece of cake!
